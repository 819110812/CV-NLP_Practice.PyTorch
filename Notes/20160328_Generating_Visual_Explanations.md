They propose a new model that focuses on the [discriminating properties](http://dict.youdao.com/w/discriminating/#keyfrom=dict.top) of the visible object, jointly predicts a class label, and explains why the predicted label is appropriate for the image. A loss function based on sampling and reinforcement learning that learns to generate sentences that **realize a global sentence property**, such as [class specificity](http://dict.youdao.com/w/class%20specificity/#keyfrom=dict.top).
